"""Give all values of Skew for Genome equal to "GAGCCACCGCGATA" as a collection of space-separated integers.
Use the sample dataset below to help!

his array, denoted Skew, is defined by setting Skew[i] equal to the number of occurrences of G minus the number
of occurrences of C in the first i nucleotides of Genome (see figure below). We also set Skew[0] equal to zero.
Given a DNA string Genome, we can form its skew array by setting Skew[0] equal to 0, and then rangingï»¿ through Genome.
At position i of Genome, if we encounter A or T, then we set Skew[i+1] equal to Skew[i]; if we encounter a G,
then we set Skew[i+1] equal to Skew[i]+1; if we encounter a C, then we set Skew[i+1] equal to Skew[i]-1."""
